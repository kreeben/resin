distribute data set across many servers (sharding, replication; RPC) or in other ways allow for horisontal scaling

----
memory mapping (to increase speed of querying and perhaps also writing; to increase scalability)
update index (allow removal of documents; allow appending to an already persisted index token's postings list)
async IO (for scalability)
indexing of types other than string
enable combining fields with different types in a document/model
split application into "crawler" and "search"
