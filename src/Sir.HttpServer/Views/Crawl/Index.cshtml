            <h2>Here are four ways to crawl your result:</h2>
            <p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="job" value="fi" /> <strong>Fetch WARC files and index</strong> their content.</label>
            </p>
            <p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="job" value="ei" /> <strong>Extract from WARC files and index</strong> those resources referenced in your result.</label>
            </p>
            <p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="job" value="wci" /> <strong>Web crawl and index</strong> those resources referenced in your result.</label>
            </p>
            <p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="job" value="wcir" /> <strong>Recurringly web crawl and index</strong> those resources referenced in your result.</label>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Always included:</strong> When the crawling job has completed we will have created a 
                searchable document collection from the data that was collected during the crawl. 
                We will host this document collection. You will be able to query it using a web browser, 
                join it with other collections and, with a proper HTTP client, query, append to or download it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Name your collection carefully.
                You will need to reference your collection by name anytime you query or write.
            </p>
            <p><input type="text" placeholder="Name your collection" name="collection" /><input type="submit" /></p>
        </div>
    </form>
