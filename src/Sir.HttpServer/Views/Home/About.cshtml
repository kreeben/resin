            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="/?collection=cc_wat">crawlcrawler.com</a> is a free, open, non-tracking search service created by search consultant marcuslager (at gailm'n'such).
                It is a crawl crawler but functions very much like a web search engine only with a few more manual steps involved.
                Allow me to explain.
            </p>
            <h3>Three collections</h3>
            <p>
                There are three collections.
            </p>
            <h4>First collection</h4>
            <p>
                The first collection is called "cc_wat" because it's created and refreshed when <strong>this service</strong>
                analyzes Common Crawl's <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WAT-Format">WAT meta data repository</a>.
                The documents in it contain the fields meta "title", meta "description", the "url" field
                of a document as well as these URL segment fields:
                "scheme", "host", "path" and "query".
            </p>
            <h4>Second collection</h4>
            <p>
                The second collection is called "cc_wet" and it's created and refreshed when <strong>you</strong> use your favorite
                browser to click on "Enrich" from a search result page.
                Your choice to enrich will be between having this service fetch the complete text extraction
                of all pages in your search result, optionally considering the "skip" and "take" query string parameters,
                from either Common Crawl's <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WET-Format">WET textual data repository</a>,
                or from the WWW, analyze it and append to the secondary index.
                Documents in the cc_wet collection contain the fields "title" and "description".
            </p>
            <h4>Your collection</h4>
            <p>
                The third collection (type) are the collections <strong>you</strong> create when you click
                "Save as" from a search result page. You may save your search result as a new collection that we will host.
                If you remember the name of your collection you may also append to it.
                In fact, anyone who knows that name can both query and append to it.
            </p>
            <h3>Enrich search result</h3>
            <p>
                The actual text content that lives inside of a HTML document's body tag will not always have been
                indexed by this search engine at the time of your query.
                If that's the case then you'll see a "Enrich" link on the search result page.
                Click "Enrich" then choose if you want us to fetch the textual content that Common Crawl extracted,
                for all of the pages in your result, or from WWW.
                We'll add that textual data to another of our publicly available indexes ("cc_wet").
            </p>
            <h3>Querying</h3>
            <p>
                Use the "collection" query string parameter to direct your queries towards one or more collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the "field" query string parameter to direct your queries towards one or more fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replace "OR=OR" query string entry with "AND=AND" for stricter interpretation of your query.
            </p>
            <p>
                Page by using "skip" and "take".
            </p>
