            <p><strong>For how long will crawlcrawler.com store IP addresses and their correponding time stamps, extracted from each request being made into your servers?</strong></p>
            <p>
                We will store them in working memory for the duration of the request but use them mostly in the beginning of said request, to determine
                if you belong on our servers, after which we will discard them, unless you're doing something wrong, in which case we will store them for as long as we se fit.

            <p><strong>I've been making bad requests into crawlcrawler.com's server, but now I regret it. Can I regain access to your service, if so, how?</strong></p>
            <p>Of course! Simply apologize and we're square. You may screw up, then apologize, three times. After that we won't trust you anymore.</p>
            <p><strong>I've screwed up four times. Now what?</strong></p>
            <p>You're totally screwed, man, for life! You're IP address is no good around here no more. Get outta here with your IP address!</p>
