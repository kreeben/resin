            <p>If you have some money just laying around, may I ask if you'd consider keeping this crawler common?</p>
            <p>
            If you're like me and would like for everyone to have a common Common Crawl crawl crawler, 
            then please consider helping us with our server costs by <a href="https://www.paypal.me/marcuslager">donating</a> 
            a dollar, or any other sum.

            <p>Thank you! :)</p>
